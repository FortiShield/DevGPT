## TL;DR

To help you rapidly prototype multi-agent solutions for your tasks, we are introducing DevGpt Studio, an interface powered by [DevGpt](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/tree/main/devgpt). It allows you to:

- Declaratively define and modify agents and multi-agent workflows through a point and click, drag and drop interface (e.g., you can select the parameters of two agents that will communicate to solve your task).
- Use our UI to create chat sessions with the specified agents and view results (e.g., view chat history, generated files, and time taken).
- Explicitly add skills to your agents and accomplish more tasks.
- Publish your sessions to a local gallery.


See the official DevGpt Studio documentation [here](https://khulnasoft.github.io/devgpt/docs/devgpt-studio/getting-started) for more details.

DevGpt Studio is open source [code here](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/tree/main/samples/apps/devgpt-studio), and can be installed via pip. Give it a try!

```bash
pip install devgptstudio
```

## Introduction

The accelerating pace of technology has ushered us into an era where digital assistants (or agents) are becoming integral to our lives. [DevGpt](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/tree/main/devgpt) has emerged as a leading framework for orchestrating the power of agents. In the spirit of expanding this frontier and democratizing this capability, we are thrilled to introduce a new user-friendly interface: **DevGpt Studio**.

With DevGpt Studio, users can rapidly create, manage, and interact with agents that can learn, adapt, and collaborate. As we release this interface into the open-source community, our ambition is not only to enhance productivity but to inspire a level of personalized interaction between humans and agents.

> **Note**: DevGpt Studio is meant to help you rapidly prototype multi-agent workflows and demonstrate an example of end user interfaces built with DevGpt. It is not meant to be a production-ready app.

## Getting Started with DevGpt Studio

The following guide will help you get DevGpt Studio up and running on your system.

### Configuring an LLM Provider

To get started, you need access to a language model. You can get this set up by following the steps in the DevGpt documentation [here](https://khulnasoft.github.io/devgpt/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints). Configure your environment with either `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`.

For example, in your terminal, you would set the API key like this:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

You can also specify the model directly in the agent's configuration as shown below.

```python
llm_config = LLMConfig(
    config_list=[{
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "api_key": "<azure_api_key>",
        "base_url": "<azure api base url>",
        "api_type": "azure",
        "api_version": "2024-02-01"
    }],
    temperature=0,
)
```

### Installation

There are two ways to install DevGpt Studio - from PyPi or from source. We **recommend installing from PyPi** unless you plan to modify the source code.

1. **Install from PyPi**

   We recommend using a virtual environment (e.g., conda) to avoid conflicts with existing Python packages. With Python 3.10 or newer active in your virtual environment, use pip to install DevGpt Studio:

   ```bash
   pip install devgptstudio
   ```

2. **Install from Source**

   > Note: This approach requires some familiarity with building interfaces in React.

   If you prefer to install from source, ensure you have Python 3.10+ and Node.js (version above 14.15.0) installed. Here's how you get started:

   - Clone the DevGpt Studio repository and install its Python dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install -e .
     ```

   - Navigate to the `samples/apps/devgpt-studio/frontend` directory, install dependencies, and build the UI:

     ```bash
     npm install -g gatsby-cli
     npm install --global yarn
     yarn install
     yarn build
     ```

   For Windows users, to build the frontend, you may need alternative commands provided in the [devgpt studio readme](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/tree/main/samples/apps/devgpt-studio).

### Running the Application

Once installed, run the web UI by entering the following in your terminal:

```bash
devgptstudio ui --port 8081
```

This will start the application on the specified port. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8081/` to begin using DevGpt Studio.

Now that you have DevGpt Studio installed and running, you are ready to explore its capabilities, including defining and modifying agent workflows, interacting with agents and sessions, and expanding agent skills.

## What Can You Do with DevGpt Studio?

The DevGpt Studio UI is organized into 3 high level sections - **Build**, **Playground**, and **Gallery**.

### Build

![Specify Agents.](img/devgptstudio_config.png)

This section focuses on defining the properties of agents and agent workflows. It includes the following concepts:

**Skills**: Skills are functions (e.g., Python functions) that describe how to solve a task. In general, a good skill has a descriptive name (e.g. `generate_images`), extensive docstrings and good defaults (e.g., writing out files to disk for persistence and reuse). You can add new skills to DevGpt Studio via the provided UI. At inference time, these skills are made available to the assistant agent as they address your tasks.

<p align="center">

    leverage in addressing tasks.
  </em>
</p>

**Agents**: This provides an interface to declaratively specify properties for an DevGpt agent (mirrors most of the members of a base [DevGpt conversable agent](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/blob/main/devgpt/agentchat/conversable_agent.py) class).

**Agent Workflows**: An agent workflow is a specification of a set of agents that can work together to accomplish a task. The simplest version of this is a setup with two agents – a user proxy agent (that represents a user i.e. it compiles code and prints result) and an assistant that can address task requests (e.g., generating plans, writing code, evaluating responses, proposing error recovery steps, etc.). A more complex flow could be a group chat where even more agents work towards a solution.

### Playground

<p align="center">

    (ability to generate images) to address a user task (generate pdf's).
  </em>
</p>

The playground section is focused on interacting with agent workflows defined in the previous build section. It includes the following concepts:

**Session**: A session refers to a period of continuous interaction or engagement with an agent workflow, typically characterized by a sequence of activities or operations aimed at achieving specific objectives. It includes the agent workflow configuration, the interactions between the user and the agents. A session can be “published” to a “gallery”.

**Chat View**: A chat is a sequence of interactions between a user and an agent. It is a part of a session.

### Gallery

This section is focused on sharing and reusing artifacts (e.g., workflow configurations, sessions, etc.).

DevGpt Studio comes with 3 example skills: `fetch_profile`, `find_papers`, `generate_images`. Please feel free to review the repo to learn more about how they work.

## The DevGpt Studio API

While DevGpt Studio is a web interface, it is powered by an underlying python API that is reusable and modular. Importantly, we have implemented an API where agent workflows can be declaratively specified (in JSON), loaded and run. An example of the current API is shown below. Please consult the [DevGpt Studio repo](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/tree/main/samples/apps/devgpt-studio) for more details.

```python
import json
from devgptstudio import DevGptWorkFlowManager, AgentWorkFlowConfig

# load an agent specification in JSON
agent_spec = json.load(open('agent_spec.json'))

# Create an DevGpt Workflow Configuration from the agent specification
agent_work_flow_config = FlowConfig(**agent_spec)

# Create a Workflow from the configuration
agent_work_flow = DevGptWorkFlowManager(agent_work_flow_config)

# Run the workflow on a task
task_query = "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?"
agent_work_flow.run(message=task_query)
```

## Road Map and Next Steps

As we continue to develop and refine DevGpt Studio, the road map below outlines an array of enhancements and new features planned for future releases. Here's what users can look forward to:

- **Complex Agent Workflows**: We're working on integrating support for more sophisticated agent workflows, such as `GroupChat`, allowing for richer interaction between multiple agents or dynamic topologies.
- **Improved User Experience**: This includes features like streaming intermediate model output for real-time feedback, better summarization of agent responses, information on costs of each interaction. We will also invest in improving the workflow for composing and reusing agents. We will also explore support for more interactive human in the loop feedback to agents.
- **Expansion of Agent Skills**: We will work towards improving the workflow for authoring, composing and reusing agent skills.
- **Community Features**: Facilitation of sharing and collaboration within DevGpt Studio user community is a key goal. We're exploring options for sharing sessions and results more easily among users and contributing to a shared repository of skills, agents, and agent workflows.

### FAQ

**Q: Where can I adjust the default skills, agent and workflow configurations?**
A: You can modify agent configurations directly from the UI or by editing the `devgpttstudio/utils/dbdefaults.json` file which is used to initialize the database.

**Q: If I want to reset the entire conversation with an agent, how do I go about it?**
A: To reset your conversation history, you can delete the `database.sqlite` file. If you need to clear user-specific data, remove the relevant `devgptstudio/web/files/user/<user_id_md5hash>` folder.

**Q: Is it possible to view the output and messages generated by the agents during interactions?**
A: Yes, you can view the generated messages in the debug console of the web UI, providing insights into the agent interactions. Alternatively, you can inspect the `database.sqlite` file for a comprehensive record of messages.

**Q: Where can I find documentation and support for DevGpt Studio?**
A: We are constantly working to improve DevGpt Studio. For the latest updates, please refer to the [DevGpt Studio Readme](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/tree/main/samples/apps/devgpt-studio). For additional support, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt) or ask questions on [Discord](https://aka.ms/devgpt-dc).

**Q: Can I use Other Models with DevGpt Studio?**
Yes. DevGpt standardizes on the openai model api format, and you can use any api server that offers an openai compliant endpoint. In the DevGpt Studio UI, each agent has an `llm_config` field where you can input your model endpoint details including `model name`, `api key`, `base url`, `model type` and `api version`. For Azure OpenAI models, you can find these details in the Azure portal. Note that for Azure OpenAI, the `model name` is the deployment id or engine, and the `model type` is "azure".
For other OSS models, we recommend using a server such as vllm to instantiate an openai compliant endpoint.

**Q: The Server Starts But I Can't Access the UI**
A: If you are running the server on a remote machine (or a local machine that fails to resolve localhost correstly), you may need to specify the host address. By default, the host address is set to `localhost`. You can specify the host address using the `--host <host>` argument. For example, to start the server on port 8081 and local address such that it is accessible from other machines on the network, you can run the following command:

```bash
devgptstudio ui --port 8081 --host 0.0.0.0
```
