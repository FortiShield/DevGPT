![MemGPT Example](img/ecosystem-memgpt.png)

MemGPT enables LLMs to manage their own memory and overcome limited context windows. You can use MemGPT to create perpetual chatbots that learn about you and modify their own personalities over time. You can connect MemGPT to your own local filesystems and databases, as well as connect MemGPT to your own tools and APIs. The MemGPT + DevGpt integration allows you to equip any DevGpt agent with MemGPT capabilities.
